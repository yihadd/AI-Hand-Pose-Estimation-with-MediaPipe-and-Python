### this project going to do is Hand pose Estimation using Mediapipe so you will be able to use webcam to be able to track all the joints within your hand in real time.

#what we are going to do?
###installing Media Pipe.
###Detecting hand poses.
###Outputting image by OpenCV.

### Mediapipe and OpenCV are going to be two core dependency
### Mediapipe >> computer solution >> you able to use hand pose tracking, body pose tracking, facial landmark tracking etc.
### OpenCV >> open computer vision libraries it allow to work with a webcam amd imagies really well.

### next i will import those independency
